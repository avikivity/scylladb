// need schema reference at the time object is constructed. We can't lookup
// schema before we deserialize column family ID. Another problem is that even
// if we had the ID somehow, low level RPC layer doesn't know how to lookup
// the schema. Data can be wrapped in frozen_mutation without schema
// information, the schema is only needed to access some of the fields.
